# Introduction

## What is green software?

Green software is an emerging discipline at the intersection of climate science, software design, electricity markets, hardware, and data center design. The Green Software Practitioner Certification shows you how to define, build, and run green software applications. This certification lays out the guidelines to help create a shared understanding of what it means to be a green software practitioner, irrespective of the application domain, industry, organization size or type (cloud vendor or self-hosted), programming language or framework.

Green software is carbon-efficient software, meaning it emits the least carbon possible. Only three activities reduce the carbon emissions of software; energy efficiency, carbon awareness, and hardware efficiency. This training will explain all of these concepts, how to apply them to your processes and how to measure them, as well as some of the international guidelines and organizations that guide and monitor this space.

## Who should read this?

Anyone involved in the process of building, deploying, or managing software. By studying these principles, a green software practitioner can make decisions that have a meaningful impact on the carbon pollution of their applications.

## History

In 2019 the original eight principles of green software engineering were released. This 2022 update of the principles took on feedback received over the years, merging some principles and adding a new one regarding understanding climate commitments.

## How to be a green software practitioner

The following certification covers 6 key areas that a green software practitioner should know:

1. **Carbon Efficiency**: Emit the least amount of carbon possible.
2. **Energy Efficiency**: Use the least amount of energy possible.
3. **Carbon Awareness**: Do more when the electricity is cleaner and do less when the electricity is dirtier.
4. **Hardware Efficiency**: Use the least amount of embodied carbon possible.
5. **Measuring**: What you can't measure, you can't improve.
6. **Climate Commitments**: Understand the exact mechanism of reduction.

Each of these chapters will introduce some new concepts and explain in detail why they are important in terms of the climate, and how you can apply them to your green software practices.
