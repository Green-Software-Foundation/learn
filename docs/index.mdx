## Summary

The concepts a software practitioner needs to know to build, maintain and run greener
applications are not taught in traditional software curriculums. The lack of a shared
language or standardized terms complicates green software communication. The green
software space is moving very fast, but the knowledge required to engage meaningfully
takes time.

As organizations look to hire green software talent, we need a method of evaluating the knowledge of software practitioners to ensure they meet a minimum and consistent level of understanding.

This repository contains the training for various Green Software courses including the Green Software Practitioner Certification
