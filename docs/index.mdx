# Learning Green Software

This learning site contains materials created by the [Community Working Group](https://community.greensoftware.foundation) in The [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation) to educate software practitioners in topics related to green software.

This site exists because the concepts a software practitioner needs to know to build, maintain and run greener applications are not taught in traditional software curriculums. The lack of a shared language or standardized terms complicates green software communication.

As organizations look to hire green software talent, we need a method of evaluating the knowledge of software practitioners to ensure they meet a minimum and consistent level of understanding.

This site contains the training for various Green Software courses including the [Green Software Practitioner Course](https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/practitioner/introduction) which is the first training we recommend anyone to take.

The main website for this material is https://learn.greensoftware.foundation and the source for this site can be found on our GitHub https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/training.
